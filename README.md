## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

I watched Kevin Powell's YouTube video where he uses CUBE CSS on the Order Summary challenge and was really interested to try this approach out on a challenge myself. I don't know how much this particular challenge lends itself to CUBE but I had a go anyway. I really love the way the `.flow > * + *` works! I was really taken by this - I used a border on this class initially to see the effect it has on a layout. I love the idea of using the cascade to 'flow' the styles. It makes so much sense! I have done a few challenges prior to this but this approach makes me realise I was kind of 'pixel pushing' on those and in my attempts to get the layout just right I was just tinkering around with the individual elements without too much thinking about the 'flow' of the whole page. In fact I loved it so much I dreamt about it and .... ok this is too much now. I realise I have probably made a bit of a ham-fisted attempt at this but I'm really motivated now to check the methodology out more andget right stuck in with it.

### Continued development

I really beleive CUBE CSS is the way forward. So that is my continued development!
Also Grid layouts - there's a lot to be learnt here too....

### Useful resources
